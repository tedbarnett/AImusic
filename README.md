Playing with music generation using AI in Python

Trying out scamp (https://github.com/MarcTheSpark/scamp)

From https://github.com/MarcTheSpark/scamp
and from http://scamp.marcevanstein.com/

On a Mac or PC, open the terminal and enter (without the quotes):
- 'pip3 install --user scamp'
then test that it worked by entering these two lines (without the quotes):
- 'python3'
- from scamp import test_run; test_run.play()'

You should hear piano music on your PC or Mac to confirm scamp works

Status: I can get the music sample playing on my Mac, following the instructions above.  But if I try to "import scamp", it's failing even though I installed scamp via pip3.  Still debugging this.
