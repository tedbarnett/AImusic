Playing with music generation using AI in Python

Trying out scamp (https://github.com/MarcTheSpark/scamp)

From https://github.com/MarcTheSpark/scamp
and from http://scamp.marcevanstein.com/

On a Mac or PC, open the terminal and enter (without the quotes):
- 'pip3 install --user scamp'
then test that it worked by entering these two lines (without the quotes):
- 'python3'
- from scamp import test_run; test_run.play()'

You should hear piano music on your PC or Mac to confirm scamp works. If you errors instead, its likely a Python version problem. Get the latest and run through the steps above again. 

Now working in basic form:
- Run the Python app importer.py to set up the right modules on your PC/Mac (only have to do this once)
- Paste your melody into the file "melody.txt" in the form "pitch, duration" (e.g. "C4, 0.25")
- Run the Python app play_AI_music.py to play whatever is in melody.txt
- You should hear your music!
